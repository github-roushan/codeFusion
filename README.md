A collection of my learnings and projects from various courses and books.


# 📘 Hands-On Machine Learning — Study Repository

This repository contains my notes, code, and exercises as I work through the book  
**_Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow_** by Aurélien Géron.

The goal is to document my progress, deepen understanding, and build hands-on experience in applied machine learning and deep learning using Python.
