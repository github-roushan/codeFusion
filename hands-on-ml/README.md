# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow

This repository contains my personal notes, code examples, and exercises as I work through the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron.

My goal is to solidify my understanding of the concepts presented in the book by implementing them myself and experimenting with the various techniques.

## Contents

Each chapter's content will be organized into its own directory, typically containing:

*   **Jupyter Notebooks:** My code implementations and explanations for the chapter's topics.
*   **Data:** Any datasets used in the examples (if not directly downloaded within the notebooks).
*   **Notes:** Additional markdown files for key takeaways or summaries.

## Progress

I will update this section to track my progress through the book.

<!-- *   **Chapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape** - Completed
*   **Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project** - In Progress
*   **Chapter 3: Classification** - To Do
*   ... and so on. -->

## How to Use

To run the notebooks and explore the code:

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/github-roushan/codeFusion.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd hands-on-ml
    ```
3.  (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
4.  Install the required libraries (a `requirements.txt` will be added as I progress):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  Launch Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
